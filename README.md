# ü™∂Feather BM 
100% serverless BM25 index + search 

Built with DynamoDB in mind but supports DB adapters.

‚ö†Ô∏è Probably not production ready yet.

## Tradeoffs and Usecases
**TL;DR A: Feather-BM is extremely cheap and scalable, but you have no flexibility in how you set the BM25 (k1, b, avgDL) params once you create a collection**

You'll need to estimate the average document length of your collection and know the BM25 search parameters you want to use before you create the collection.

#### Why would I use this?
- You have a large set of document collections that each have a small number of documents (less than 100,000).

   Maybe you're a Sass company that needs to manage a set of documents for each of your customers.

- Your data is basically immutable.

   Your users/data sources are publishing documents to be indexed not to be edited.

- The average reads and writes for your collections are very low and would therefore be cost ineffective to use a more expensive solution like ElasticSearch.


## Features
#### Virtually Unlimited Collections
  Collections are logical objects split across multiple partition keys designed to efficiently scale horizontally (across multiple nodes).
#### Search by keyword (Globally)
```typescript
await bm.query(
    "Arkansas Citizens First Responder Safety Enhancement Fund", //query
    "my_first_collection_name" //collection name
);
```
#### Search by keyword (Within a specified time range)
```typescript
await bm.query(
    "Arkansas Citizens First Responder Safety Enhancement Fund", //query
    "my_first_collection_name", //collection name
    "2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", //start time
    "2024-01-01T23:59:59.999Z" //end time
);
```
#### Search by title (begins_with/exact match)
```typescript
await bm.searchByTitle(
    "House Bill 1070", //title exact match or text title begins with
    "my_first_collection_name" //collection name
);
```
#### List documents in chronological created_at order
```typescript
await bm.list(
    "my_first_collection_name", //collection name
    10, //number of documents to return
    "2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", //start time
    "2024-01-01T23:59:59.999Z" //end time
);
```
#### Check if a text body already exists in a collection
```typescript
await bm.exists(
    "Arkansas Citizens First Responder Safety Enhancement Fund", //text body
    "my_first_collection_name" //collection name
);
```

## Installation
1. `npm install feather-bm`
2. Create the tables in DynamoDB
    1. Create a table called `ANY_TABLE_NAME_index` with the following attributes:
        - `pk` (string) - The partition key for the index. 
        - `id` (binary) - The uuidv7 of the document.
    2. Create a GSI on the `ANY_TABLE_NAME_index` table with the following attributes:
        - `pk` (string) - The partition key for the index.
        - `tf` (number) - The static BM25 term frequency component.
    3. Create a table called `ANY_TABLE_NAME_documents` with the following attributes:
        - `pk` (string) - The partition key for the meta data. 
        - `id` (binary) - The uuidv7 of the document.
    4. Create a GSI on the `ANY_TABLE_NAME_documents` table with the following attributes:
        - `pk` (string) - The partition key for the meta data.
        - `t` (string) - The title of the document.
3. Create AWS Client Credentials with access to the tables.
 ```typescript
 const dynamo_client = new DynamoDBClient({
     region: "us-west-2",
     credentials: {
         accessKeyId : "fakeKey",
         secretAccessKey: "fakeSecret"
     }
 });
 ```



## Usage
```typescript
import { FeatherBM } from 'feather-bm';

const bm = await FeatherBM.fromDynamoDB(dynamo_client, "ANY_TABLE_NAME");

await bm.insert(docs, "my_first_collection_name");

const title_result = await bm.searchByTitle("House Bill 1070", "my_first_collection_name");

const query_result = await bm.query("Arkansas Citizens First Responder Safety Enhancement Fund", "my_first_collection_name");

```

## Testing
#### Unit Tests
Feather-BM Unit tests use an in memory bootleg of DynamoDB functionality. 

#### Integration Tests
Feather-BM Integration tests use a local DynamoDB instance.
To create the local DynamoDB instance:
1. Install Docker Desktop (or Docker)
2. Use the docker-compose file in the repo to create the local DynamoDB instance.
```bash
docker-compose up -d docker/dynamo_db_local/docker-compose.yml
```
